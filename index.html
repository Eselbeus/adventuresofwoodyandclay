      <p class="component__story">Adventures of Woody and Clay began as a notorious stick-figure comic on an Angelfire page back in 2002. The comic is themed around the board game, <strong>Catan.</strong>
        This official site for the comic will provide a new home for the series as well as updates for potential new adventures.

      Woody and Clay was never just about Settlers of Catan or "Catan" as it is now called. The comic also relates to other titles in the series.
      This includes primarily Starfarers of Catan as well as the Cities and Knights expansion. I was disappointed for years that Starfarers of Catan was out of print.
      However, the new Catan: Starfarers is an excellent reprint of the game and I dare say, it is an improvement. The number one upgrade is the game components.
      The original game motherships would chip and fall apart and you couldn't actually attach the boosters to them without them breaking. This problem is solved by the new component design.
      The second huge upgrade is the variable map layouts that enable you to swap the position of systems! You can wander around space not knowing exactly what you might encounter each game.
      The ability flip the system over and keep them secret greatly adds to the theme of exploring space. Also because of the modular, puzzle-piece board design, it is easy to see how expansions could easily be added to the game.
      I highly recommend the new edition! 99% of the original game has been preserved and the quality is a huge improvement!
