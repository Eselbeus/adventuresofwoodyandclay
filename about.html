      <p class="component__story">The original 50-episode series centers around the characters Woody and Clay. Neither of them are particularly intelligent charachters and each is totally infatuated by the resource that they represent: For Woody, that resourse is wood, and for Clay that resourse is clay.
    They join forces to some degree with a character called Catanman, who apparently has some superpowers. One would assume he can fly since he has a cape. He is also a bit of a pothead and therefore his favorite resource is sheep, because well...they dwell in the <em>grass</em>. While Catanman
    and Clay have a strong relationship, Woody often antagonizes both of them...and vise versa. That being said, the three of them really are friends at the end of the day. The true nemesis of the trio is Dr. Shepard who is trying to turn the whole universe into a haven for sheep. While Cataman
    loves sheep, he understands the need for balance for both Catanworld and the Catanverse. Most of the journeys of the charachters centers on them trying to give a tour of Cataworld for the reader, and subsequently failing miserably.</p>
