    <h1 class="title">The Background Story</h1>
    <h2>A Catan Comic</h2>
    <p class="story">The original 50-episode series centers around the characters Woody and Clay. Neither of them are particularly intelligent charachters and each is totally infatuated by the resource that they represent: For Woody, that resourse is wood, and for Clay that resourse is clay.
    They join forces to some degree with a character called Catanman, who apparently has some superpowers. One would assume he can fly since he has a cape. He is also a bit of a pothead and therefore his favorite resource is sheep, because well...they dwell in the <em>grass</em></p>
